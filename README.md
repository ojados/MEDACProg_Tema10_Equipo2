# PROG - T10 - Pr√°ctica Biblioteca: MEDACProg_Tema10_Equipo2

This project focuses on developing a management system for a library that includes various materials such as books and magazines. The goal is to create an efficient structure to organize and manage these materials, taking into account the specific characteristics of each type.

## Context
Let's assume you are designing a system to manage a library that includes different types of materials, such as books and magazines. Additionally, there is a need to track specific information for each type of material, for example, the number of pages for books and the number of articles for magazines. Implement this system using inheritance and abstract classes.
